# lung-cancer-survival-analysis
This repository implements survival analysis on the NCCTG Lung Cancer dataset, including Kaplan-Meier estimation for survival probabilities, subgroup analysis based on sex, age, weight loss, and Karnofsky/ECOG scores, Cox Proportional Hazards model to assess predictors, and cumulative hazard function using the Nelson-Aalen estimator.
This repository implements standard survival analysis techniques on the NCCTG Lung Cancer dataset (or a dataset named "cancer.csv"). Key features include:

Kaplan-Meier Estimation: Calculating and visualizing survival probabilities over time for different subgroups.

Survival Analysis by Factors: Comparing survival curves based on factors such as sex, age, weight loss, and Karnofsky/ECOG scores.

Cox Proportional Hazards Model: Building a model to evaluate the impact of various predictors on survival.

Cumulative Hazard Function: Using the Nelson-Aalen estimator to estimate cumulative hazard.
